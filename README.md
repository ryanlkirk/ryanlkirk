## About Me
Hi, I'm Ryan. Welcome to my little corner of Github! I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building intuitive and beautiful user interfaces using React.

Yet another react dev huh? So what sets me apart? It's my love of writing code that people don't hate working on.

I mean, think about it - readable code is like a love letter to your future self (or another developer who has to work on the same codebase). It's like saying, "Hey, I care about you and your sanity, so I'm going to make sure this code is easy to understand and maintain." So yes, I take readable code seriously.

I have worked on products that are used by hundreds of thousands of individual users, across more than 30 countries and 4 continents. I've had the pleasure of building performant, reliable software that is trusted by a wide array of customers, from tiny rural schools to billion dollar businesses.

So if you're looking for a React developer who's passionate, dedicated, and slightly obsessed with code quality, then you've come to the right place. Let's build something amazing together

## Currently working on:
